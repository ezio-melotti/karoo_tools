Spent the better part of today working throgh my archive of working but could-be-better tools, giving them the final
touches to bring them into the Karoo family. Now each has a proper old-school-is-cool banner, nearly identical code
flow, and for the most part, similar naming scheme for the variables. This creates some familiarity to the total
package such that if you dive into one, modifying it for your own local needs, it will be easy to do so again with
the next.

I have yet to upload the karoo_pipeline as I have one more modification to take it out of its LIGO foundation and
into a more generic functionality.
