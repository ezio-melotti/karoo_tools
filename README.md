# Karoo Tools

Karoo Tools help you prepare your data for Machine Learning runs. Each Tool has one function. Simple to learn, easy
to use. Let me know if I have achieved this goal. An introduction to each Tool is included in the header. 

To learn more:
	cat karoo_[tool].py

Unless otherwise specified, each Karoo Tool is run as follows:

(in Python direct)
	python karoo_[tool].py [data.csv]

(in iPython)
	run karoo_[tool].py [data.csv]


More tools coming soon ...
